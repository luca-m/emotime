\section{Workflow}

The original workflow was:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dataset preparation and AdaBoost training.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM} Python tool development for automatic training.
      \item \textbf{LM} Tools and functions for AdaBoost training using OpenCV.
      \item \textbf{DB} Tools and functions for feature extraction by means of Gabor Filter.
    \end{itemize}
  \item AdaBoost feature selection and SVM training.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM} AdaBoost feature selection and specialized Gabor filter.
      \item \textbf{DB} Tools and functions for SVM training using OpenCV.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Testing
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM} Prediction tools and functions for AdaBoost prediction
      \item \textbf{DB} Prediction tools and functions for SVM prediction
    \end{itemize}
  \item End-User application
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM,DB} GUI for video, webcam and images.
      \item \textbf{DB} Release of dynamic libraries and trained classifiers.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

However during the completion of point 1, we faced various problems using
AdaBoost (more details in~\ref{res:issues}) and we discarded it. Thus, the
workflow adapted:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dataset preparation and AdaBoost training.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM} Python tool development for automatic training.
      \item \textbf{LM} Tools and functions for AdaBoost training using OpenCV.
      \item \textbf{DB} Tools and functions for feature extraction by means of Gabor Filter.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Improved feature extraction and SVM training.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM} Implementation of face rotation using eye position.
      \item \textbf{DB} Tools and functions for SVM training using OpenCV.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Testing and Refractoring
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM} Tools and GUIs for determination of Gabor parameters.
      \item \textbf{DB} Prediction tools and functions for prediction.
      \item \textbf{LM,DB} Code refractoring from functions to classes.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Parameters optimization
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM,DB} Study of papers and formulae for determination of
        SVM parameters.
      \item \textbf{LM,DB} Study of papers and formulae for determination of
        Gabor parameters.
    \end{itemize}
  \item End-User application
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{LM,DB} GUI for video, webcam and images.
      \item \textbf{DB} Release of dynamic libraries and trained classifiers.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The study of SVM parameters was discarded for the absence of a validation set.
