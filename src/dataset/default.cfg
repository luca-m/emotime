[FOLDER]
# Folder containing the raw images (should contain a subfolder for each classes to recognize)
IMAGES:     images
# Folder containing the cropped faces (should contain a subfolder for each classes to recognize)
FACES:      faces
# Folder containing the features calculated for each face image.
# Should have a first layer of subfolder named as classes to recognize, and inside each 
# class subfolder should contains a folder for each face image that belongs to that class
FEATURES:   features
# Folder containing the csv files of the features for training set and validation set (one file per classifier)
TRAIN:      training
# Folder containing the trained classifiers (auspiciously should be opencv .xml files)

[TRAIN]
# Write samples features directly in the csv file prepared for training, this way is possible to use CvMLData.read_csv for 
# loading sample data. If "False" do not embed any feature in the csv file, instead specify the file path where to find 
# the feature matrix of the sample.
